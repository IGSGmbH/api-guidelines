# Federal Administration API Guidelines
## 1. Introduction
These REST API Guidelines pick up where the federal API architecture leaves off. It follows the vision "As a modern administration, we simplify access to our government services for our partners by making services usable through any electronic means". These are design guidelines for RESTful APIs and we encourage all API developers in the federal administration to follow them to ensure that our APIs:

are easy to understand and learn

are general and abstracted from specific implementation and use cases

are robust and easy to use

have a common look and feel

follow a consistent RESTful style and syntax

are consistent with other teams’ APIs

RESTful APIs (Representational State Transferful Application Programming Interfaces) are APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that adhere to the principles and constraints of the REST architectural style. These APIs are designed to facilitate communication and data exchange between different software systems over the web. To learn more about REST, we refer you to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST, other online sources or relevant specialist literature.

The guidelines are based on Zalando’s RESTful API and Event Guidelines. Thanks to Zalando for their valuable work and for making the guidelines available.
